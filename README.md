# Fogborn Tactics

This repo is an experiment in creating a Tactics RPG game engine in Vue. It features a player character, multiple enemies, isometric & top down viewing modes, simulated terrain, basic enemy AI, melee & ranged attacks, and even magical powers (taken from Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series). This style of game was one of my favorites while I was growing up, and it was a real joy to recreate it using technologies I'm familiar with.

## Getting Started

To run: `npm install && npm run dev`
